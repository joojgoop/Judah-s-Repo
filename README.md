# Whole Brain
      This last october I participated in an arts and crafts competition. 
     I found out about it in the last 3 weeks of submission time so I had 
     to work diligently to get the project done in time. usually my art is 
     explosive and random and creation exemplified, but i had to be efficient 
     and break my painting into painting portions. This forced me to be logistical 
     and analytical while also being artistic, proving the effectiveness of whole brain theory.

# Elevator Pitch

  quality art and passion into the forefronts of human values by making connections and working
  with creative/passionate individuals on projects that will help to accomplish this."
# Week 1 Review
  This first week has been really valuable to me because I have learned to get my head into an entirely different mode
  than what I or a lot of people are used to. I got to learn about my cohort and found that I am surrounded by likeminded individuals
  and that is a comforting feeling. I also am so happy that I have found a program that thinks about how creative people think and 
  tailors the teaching and class style as such. Am intrigued and excited to see all the stuff we are gonna be learning about. 
# Visuals Speak
  My first photo for this activity depicts a large jar with lots of paintbrushes and different tools an artist would use while working. I    felt this photo related to my current career status in the way that I am the Jar and am constantly adding knew tools, experience, and knowledge of them to my collection. My second photo depicts a wealthy individual with money falling from his pockets and other hands reaching for it, symbolizing to me the success and wealth I am going to acquire with my tools. The way that I am going to bridge the gap between these two photos is by actively adding to my collection of skills and tools while learning and applying them in a business environment and mindset.
