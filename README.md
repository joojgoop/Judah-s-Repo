# Whole Brain
      This last october I participated in an arts and crafts competition. 
     I found out about it in the last 3 weeks of submission time so I had 
     to work diligently to get the project done in time. usually my art is 
     explosive and random and creation exemplified, but i had to be efficient 
     and break my painting into painting portions. This forced me to be logistical 
     and analytical while also being artistic, proving the effectiveness of whole brain theory.

# Week 1 Review
  This first week has been really valuable to me because I have learned to get my head into an entirely different mode
  than what I or a lot of people are used to. I got to learn about my cohort and found that I am surrounded by likeminded individuals
  and that is a comforting feeling. I also am so happy that I have found a program that thinks about how creative people think and 
  tailors the teaching and class style as such. Am intrigued and excited to see all the stuff we are gonna be learning about.
